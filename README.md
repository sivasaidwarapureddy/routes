JavaScript: The code is written in JavaScript, using modern syntax and features such as async/await and arrow functions.
These technologies suggest that you have experience with:

Building RESTful APIs using Express.js
Interacting with MongoDB databases using Mongoose
Writing JavaScript code using modern syntax and features
